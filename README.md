I have QPython3 on my phone &amp; sometimes I write little scripts on there. I'm planning to upload them here. 

For most of these scripts, especially photoPriv.py, I recommend installing QPython3 from the google play app store (free). 

FYI, the default directory for QPython3 scripts is /sdcard/com.hipipal.qpyplus
So the easiest way to use photoPriv.py would be to view/download it by clicking the raw link (text only page) then saving it to the folder /sdcard/com.hipipal.qpyplus or if you downloaded it to /sdcard/Download you can browse to there in QPython3 open/edit view & then run.
